# Blind Eye

### High Concept

Blind Eye is a two player, 3D, third person, cooperative battle arena defense game where players must work together and coordinate attacks to defeat enemies and defend the last remaining Shrine. Playing as Crow and Phoenix, warriors from the world of Diviniavis, use their divine powers to control birds to protect the realm from the World Eaters. Combining abilities with their teammate will allow the players to deal increased damage or aid each other in combat. Buy time for the Shrine to charge enough energy to cleanse Divinavis of the World Eaters.

* KEY FEATURES
* Cooperative Combat - The two players are encouraged to use their abilities to assist their ally in order to defeat enemies and defend the shrine in the most efficient way. 
* Invisible Enemy - The Hunter can cloak itself in shadow during its fight with the players, rendering it invisible.
* Crumbling Environment - The world that the players are fighting in is being devoured by the world eaters, so it is steadily becoming more unstable.

### Core Pillars
* Coordinated Attacks - Creating a combat system that allows the player to attack on their own while combining their abilities with their teammate to create a stronger attack, will help to incentivize cooperative gameplay
* Unpredictable Intensity - The intensity of the game steadily increases as the Burrowers spawn multiple Snappers targeting both the Shrine and the players and the sudden arrival of the Hunter on the field to stalk the player.
* Hunter and Hunted - The player gets a sense of being a powerful hunter, easily defeating groups of weaker enemies while tracking down the one spawning them. On the other hand, the player has a powerful Hunter enemy that is trying to stop the playerâ€™s efforts protecting the realm.
* Birds - Instead of using the traditional point and shoot style of combat with abilities, we wanted to give the player bird-themed attacks to defeat the enemies with.
