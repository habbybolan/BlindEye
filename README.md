# GAME TITLE

### High Concept

Blind Eye is a two player, 3D, third person, cooperative battle arena defense game where players must work together and coordinate attacks to defeat enemies and defend the last remaining Shrine. Playing as Crow and Phoenix, warriors from the world of Diviniavis, use their divine powers to control birds to protect the realm from the World Eaters. Combining abilities with their teammate will allow the players to deal increased damage or aid each other in combat. Buy time for the Shrine to charge enough energy to cleanse Divinavis of the World Eaters.

* <KEY FEATURES LIST - TOP 5>
* Cooperative Combat - The two players are encouraged to use their abilities to assist their ally in order to defeat enemies and defend the shrine in the most efficient way. 
* Invisible Enemy - The Hunter can cloak itself in shadow during its fight with the players, rendering it invisible.
* Crumbling Environment - The world that the players are fighting in is being devoured by the world eaters, so it is steadily becoming more unstable.
